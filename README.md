_Game Synopsis:_ The Alkamia Adventure is an adventure game that follows two explorers, Robin and Lucky, on their journey in the Congo Basin Rainforest. The goal of their adventure is to find a rare species of flower called Alkamia, which can heal animal wounds.

The explorers must go through a series of games and puzzles to reunite with their friend.
